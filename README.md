# Play-In-Flash

## Description
Simple one button music player to make fast reference to awkward ambiguous sentences.

The app is using Wham Careless Whispers to make a funny joke and stressed the awkward ambiguous sentence your friend/collegue just said.
It have to have only one song and cut to make it quick and fast to use.

I also add three more sounds.
Besides Careless Whispers, you can now also confirm a good idea with a standing ovation, make awkward silence more awkward with cricket sound and last but not least - make boo sounds to howl somebody down.

## Version
1.2

## To be add
Secound widget with one button play/stop to make it asap.
